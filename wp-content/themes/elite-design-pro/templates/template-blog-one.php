<h2>7. Maintain Consistency</h2>

<p>Consistency is key to building brand identity and trust. Ensure that your website's design elements, color scheme, typography, and tone of voice remain consistent across all pages.</p>

<h2>8. Optimize for SEO</h2>

<p>Humans are visual creatures, so make sure your website is visually appealing. Use high-quality images, videos, and graphics to capture visitors' attention and convey your brand message effectively.</p>

<h2>9. Encourage Interaction</h2>
